NOTE: The plugin no longer uses the built-in WordPress schedules and now has it's own options that are much more configurable: Weekly, Daily, Twice Daily, Four Times Daily and Hourly.

However, we recommend you check the schedule settings afterwards to ensure the one selected is the best for your requirements.
